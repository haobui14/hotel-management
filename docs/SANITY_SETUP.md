## Common Operations

### Creating a Booking

```javascript
import { createBooking } from "@/libs/sanityUtils";

const booking = await createBooking({
  user: { _ref: userId },
  hotelRoom: { _ref: roomId },
  checkinDate: "2025-08-15",
  checkoutDate: "2025-08-20",
  // ... other booking data
});
```

### Getting Optimized Images

```javascript
import { getOptimizedImageUrl } from "@/libs/sanityUtils";

const imageUrl = getOptimizedImageUrl(room.coverImage, 800, 600, 85);
```

### Checking Room Availability

```javascript
import { validateRoomAvailability } from "@/libs/sanityUtils";

const availability = await validateRoomAvailability(
  roomId,
  "2025-08-15",
  "2025-08-20"
);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use optimized images** for better performance
2. **Validate room availability** before creating bookings
3. **Use approval workflows** for user-generated content
4. **Include alt text** for all images for accessibility
5. **Use proper error handling** for all Sanity operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing environment variables**: Check .env.local file
2. **Image not loading**: Verify image URL structure
3. **Studio access denied**: Check project ID and dataset
4. **Query errors**: Verify schema field names

### Performance Tips

1. Use `useCdn: true` in production
2. Implement proper caching strategies
3. Use optimized image queries
4. Limit query results with pagination
